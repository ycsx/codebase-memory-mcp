.SYNOPSIS
    Run the native-Windows product-surface test suite for codebase-memory-mcp.

.DESCRIPTION
    Builds the product binary (build/c/codebase-memory-mcp.exe) if it is not
    already present, then runs the deterministic Windows integration tests under
    tests/windows/ against a real codebase-memory-mcp.exe (real stdio / CLI /
    HTTP UI, real SQLite DB).

    Two categories of test:

      GUARDS      - regression guards for Windows bugs already fixed on main.
                    They must stay GREEN (exit 0); a RED (exit 1) means the fix
                    regressed and fails this runner.
                      * test_non_ascii_path.py    guards #636/#357 (fixed by #700)
                      * test_non_ascii_cache_dump.py guards #996 (writer cbm_fopen)
                      * test_hook_augment.py      guards #618      (fixed by #619)
                      * test_ui_drive_listing.py  guards #548      (roots field)
                      * test_cli_non_ascii_arg.py guards #423/#20  (wide-argv main())

      KNOWN REDS  - genuine, still-open Windows bugs reproduced at the product
                    surface. They are EXPECTED to be RED (exit 1) and are opt-in
                    (never gate CI). If one turns GREEN the underlying bug was
                    fixed and it should be promoted to a guard.
                      * (none currently - test_cli_non_ascii_arg.py was promoted to a
                        guard when the wide-argv fix for #423/#20 landed)

    Determinism: the runner sets CBM_INDEX_SUPERVISOR=0 so the path / hook / drive
    guards index in-process (the pass-level readers under test, e.g. #700's cbm_fopen
    routing, run in-process either way). The non-ASCII CLI guard is the exception - it
    drops that override to cross the real supervisor -> worker spawn, where the second
    half of #423/#20 lives (CreateProcessW delivering the wide command line).

    On native Windows the MinGW/LLVM toolchain ships no libasan/libubsan, so the
    build disables sanitizers (SANITIZE=). Where the toolchain provides
    AddressSanitizer/UBSan (Linux containers, WSL), prefer scripts/test.sh.

.PARAMETER Binary
    Path to an existing codebase-memory-mcp.exe. If omitted, the script builds it
    (target selected by -Target) into build/c/.

.PARAMETER Target
    Makefile.cbm target used when building: 'cbm-with-ui' (default; needed for the
    drive-picker guard's embedded HTTP UI) or 'cbm' (no UI - the drive guard then
    reports a precondition and is skipped).

.PARAMETER GuardsOnly
    Run only the green guards (the CI gate). Skips the opt-in known-red repros.

.PARAMETER Make
    Path to GNU make (default: 'make' on PATH; MSYS2 ships it at
    C:\msys64\usr\bin\make.exe).
