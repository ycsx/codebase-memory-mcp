/*
 * repro_issue523.c — Reproduce-first case for issue #523.
 *
 * BUG: "cross-repo-intelligence returns 0 edges for a byte-identical call/route"
 *
 * Root cause (pass_calls.c::resolve_single_call):
 *
 *   When a Python client uses `import requests` and calls
 *   `requests.get("/api/orders/{id}")`, the `requests` package is an external
 *   pip dependency whose source is NOT present in the indexed tree.
 *   `cbm_registry_resolve` resolves the callee name to a candidate QN
 *   containing "requests", but `cbm_gbuf_find_by_qn(ctx->gbuf, res.qualified_name)`
 *   returns NULL — the node does not exist in the graph because `requests` was
 *   never indexed.  The guard at pass_calls.c::resolve_single_call line ~406:
 *
 *       const cbm_gbuf_node_t *target_node = cbm_gbuf_find_by_qn(ctx->gbuf, res.qualified_name);
 *       if (!target_node || source_node->id == target_node->id)
 *           return 0;          ← call is SILENTLY DROPPED
 *
 *   causes the call to be silently dropped before it ever reaches
 *   `emit_classified_edge` / `emit_http_async_edge`.  No HTTP_CALLS edge is
 *   created in the client project DB.
 *
 *   Without an HTTP_CALLS edge in the client DB, `match_http_routes` in
 *   pass_cross_repo.c finds nothing to iterate over, and `cbm_cross_repo_match`
 *   returns http_edges == 0 — even when the server project has a perfectly
 *   matching Route node (byte-identical path, correct method) and a HANDLES
 *   edge pointing to the handler function.
 *
 * Expected (correct) behaviour:
 *   A call to an external HTTP client library (e.g. `requests.get`) with a
 *   URL/path first argument MUST produce an HTTP_CALLS edge in the client
 *   project DB, even when the library's source is not indexed.  The linker
 *   should detect the service-pattern match on the resolved QN substring
 *   ("requests") and emit the edge before consulting the node graph.
 *   Subsequently, `cbm_cross_repo_match` must produce at least one
 *   CROSS_HTTP_CALLS edge linking the client caller to the server route handler
 *   when the client url_path (canonicalized) matches the server Route QN.
 *
 * Actual (buggy) behaviour:
 *   cbm_cross_repo_match returns http_edges == 0.  The assertion below is RED.
 *
 * Companion: pass_calls.c (sequential path) and pass_parallel.c (parallel path)
 * both share the same guard; fixing one requires fixing both.
 *
 * Note on parallel pipeline:
 *   HTTP_CALLS edges are produced on BOTH the sequential (< 50 files) and
 *   parallel (>= 50 files) pipeline paths, so this test uses a small fixture
 *   (< 50 files) and exercises the sequential path.  The parallel path has the
 *   same root cause and is covered by the same fix (pass_parallel.c::
 *   finalize_and_emit has an identical unindexed-node guard).

/*
 * CLIENT SERVICE (order-client):
 *   Uses the real `requests` library imported at the top of the file.
 *   The `requests` package is NOT present in the indexed tree (no vendored
 *   source, no stub) — this is exactly the real-world multi-service scenario.
 *   The caller function `fetch_order` makes a GET request to the byte-identical
 *   path "/api/orders/{id}" that the server registers.
 *
 * WHY this triggers the bug:
 *   cbm_registry_resolve("requests.get", …) returns a candidate QN that
 *   contains "requests" (service-pattern match → CBM_SVC_HTTP), BUT
 *   cbm_gbuf_find_by_qn returns NULL for that QN because no `requests` node
 *   was ever inserted into the graph buffer.  resolve_single_call returns 0,
 *   the call is dropped, and no HTTP_CALLS edge is created.

 *      templated route QN ("__route__GET__/v2/orders/{}").
 *      → find_route_handler_fuzzy() / cr_path_matches_template()
 *   3. match_http_routes only ran src→tgt: matching initiated from the
 *      provider side finds nothing (the provider has no outbound HTTP_CALLS).
 *      → reverse-direction run in cbm_cross_repo_match()
 *   4. Worse, a provider-side run DESTROYED existing links: delete_cross_edges
 *      wiped the provider's reverse edges and — without reverse matching —

 * delete_cross_edges(server), wiping the reverse edge run 1 wrote into the
 * server DB — and, lacking reverse-direction matching, recreates nothing: a
