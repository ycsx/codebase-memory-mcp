/*
 * repro_issue964.c — Reproduce-first case for OPEN bug #964.
 *
 * Issue: #964 — "C/C++ #include not mapped as IMPORTS edges — expected or a
 * bug?" (triaged as a bug: header files look disconnected; the reporter's
 * zero-inbound query returns 194 of 214 files on a PlatformIO project).
 *
 * Root cause (deeper than the report guesses):
 *   cbm_pipeline_fqn_compute (src/pipeline/fqn.c) strips the file extension,
 *   so a header and its same-stem source collide on BOTH derived QNs:
 *     NodeController.h   -> module "proj.NodeController",
 *                           file   "proj.NodeController.__file__"
 *     NodeController.cpp -> module "proj.NodeController",
 *                           file   "proj.NodeController.__file__"
 *   Node upserts match by QN, so the header's File node is merged into the
 *   source's — the header has NO node of its own in the graph at all. The
 *   `#include "NodeController.h"` import then resolves to the shared module
 *   (named after the .cpp), and the header can never receive an inbound
 *   IMPORTS edge. Headers without a same-stem sibling keep a node but the
 *   include-edge targeting still lands on the module, not the header file.
 *
 *   NOTE: the module-QN unification itself is (at least partly) load-bearing
 *   for C/C++ — header declarations and source definitions sharing a module
 *   QN is what lets cross-file call resolution join them. The fix must give
 *   headers their own FILE identity + point include edges at it WITHOUT
 *   splitting the shared module QN. Both File-node creation sites (pipeline.c
 *   full build; pipeline_incremental.c changed-file re-creation) must agree,
 *   and the incremental site is concurrently being fixed by PR #995 (#994) —
 *   implement this fix on top of that landing, never in parallel with it.
 *
 * Expected (correct) behaviour:
 *   1. NodeController.h has its own File node (distinct from the .cpp's).
 *   2. main.cpp's `#include "NodeController.h"` produces an IMPORTS edge
 *      whose target is the HEADER's node, so the header is not disconnected.
 *
 * Why RED on current code: the header's File node does not exist (merged by
 * QN collision), so both assertions fail.
