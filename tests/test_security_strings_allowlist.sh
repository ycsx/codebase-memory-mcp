# Reproduces the smoke-windows dry-run failure:
#   BLOCKED: Unauthorized URL in binary: https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages
#   === BINARY STRING AUDIT FAILED ===
#
# Root cause: the URL audit's hardcoded ALLOWED_URLS list did not include the
# MSYS2 package-tracker URL. That URL is a toolchain artifact, analogous to the
# gcc.gnu.org / sourceware.org / bugs.launchpad.net entries already allow-listed,
# and only appears in the Windows (.exe) build — hence Linux smoke stayed green.
#
# The negative-control case proves the fix does not weaken the audit: a genuinely
# unauthorized URL must still be BLOCKED.
